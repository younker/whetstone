# Ruby: Simple Linked List

Based off of this [exercism.io exercise](https://exercism.io/my/solutions/cfdc34ebc2cf4e719335b7156f7cb732).

### Tests

`bundle exec guard`: will run tests whenever a file is changed.

To enter a `pry` console, just add a `binding.pry` breakpoint wherever you need it (it is required in `test_helper`).
